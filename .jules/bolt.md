## 2024-05-23 - [Caching Server Components with Client Auth]
**Learning:** High-traffic public pages (like Home/Landing) often fetch data (highlights, stats) that doesn't need to be real-time. By using `export const revalidate = 60` (ISR), we can cache the server-rendered HTML and data for 60 seconds, drastically reducing DB load. The key insight is that even if the page has user-specific elements (like "Welcome, [User]"), if those elements are handled in Client Components (`useAuth` hooks), the Server Component can still be safely cached because it renders the "loading" or "guest" state initially, which is then hydrated on the client.
**Action:** Always check if a Server Component's data is truly user-specific. If the user-specific parts are isolated in Client Components, enable ISR on the page level for massive performance gains.
